=head1 NAME

File::Tail::Dir - Tail all matching files in a given set of directories

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Typical usage:

  use File::Tail::Dir;

  my $tailer = File::Tail::Dir->new(  filter => qr/.*access.*log$/,
					processor => sub { 
                                              my ($filename, $lines) = @_; 
                                              ... 
                                              },
		                     );
  $tailer->watch_files();

Or, subclass:

  package My::Tailer;
  use Moose;
  extends 'File::Tail::Dir';

  # override standard 'process' method
  sub process {
    my ($self, $filename, $lines) = @_;

      ...
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Monitors and processes any lines appended to the end of one or more files in a
given list of directories, keeping state between sessions, and using kernel
notification of file change events to maximise efficiency.

A list of directories is given to monitor, and filtering/exclude expressions
allow just the files of interest to be selected for notification when lines are
appended.

This module was originally created to support lossless logging of many Apache
web server log files to a Scribe-based logging subsystem (see
L<File::Tail::Scribe>, L<Log::Dispatch::Scribe>), and hence key requirements are
to keep state, to be able to resume from the last known state between
interruptions (like server reboots), and to follow the renaming and creation of
new files during log rotation.


=head1 ALTERNATIVES

Like L<File::Tail::Multi>, L<File::Tail::App>, L<File::Tail::FAM>,
L<File::Tail>, B<File::Tail::Dir> is yet another module to tail and process one
or more files.  What B<File::Tail::Dir> provides that is different is:

=over 4

=item * Tails all matching files within a given set of directories

Apart from L<File::Tail::Multi>, the other alternatives allow monitoring of a
single file only. L<File::Tail::Multi> offers files and directories with glob
pattern expansion and filtering.  B<File::Tail::Dir> offers a list of
directories for monitoring with regular expression filtering and exclusions
based on a list of strings and/or regular expressions.

=item * Remembers state

B<File::Tail::Dir> maintains a state file, so can be stopped and started without
missing changes to files.  As it is intended to work with log files that are
periodically rotated, it will handle the situation where a file changes name
between runs.

=item * Uses kernel notification (where available) to monitor file changes

Built on Dave RolskyE<apos>s L<File::ChangeNotify>, B<File::Tail::Dir> supports
all file notification methods offered by that module.  For best performance on
Linux, it is recommended that L<Linux::Inotify2> be installed (for kernels
2.6.13 and later).  Of the similar modules listed above, only L<File::Tail::FAM>
provides event-based notification, using the older FAM kernel interface.

=back

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new

  $tailer = File::Tail::Dir->new(%options);

Options are as follows:

=over 4

=item File Selection Options

=over 4

=item * directories => \@paths

Spefify the directory paths that should be watched for changes.

=item * filter => qr/.../

This is an optional regular expression that will be used to check if a file is
of interest. This filter is only applied to files. By default, all files are
included.

=item * exclude => [...]

An optional list of paths to exclude. This list can contain either plain
strings or regular expressions. If you provide a string it should contain the
full filesystem path to be excluded.

The paths can be either directories or specific files. If the exclusion
matches a directory, all of its files and subdirectories are ignored.

=item * follow_symlinks => $bool

By default, symbolic links in the filesystem are ignored. Set this to true to follow them.

If symlinks are being followed, symlinks to files and directories
will be followed. Directories will be watched, and changes for
directories and files reported.

(Note that if this is set to true, the presence of circular link references may
cause problems due to a behaviour in the underlying L<File::ChangeNotify>).

=back

=item Processing Options

=over 4

=item * processor => sub { my ($filename, $lines) = @_; ... }

Specifies the callback function to process the arrayref of lines appended to the given file.

The default action is to print the lines to standard output.

=back

=item Miscellaneous Options

=over 4

=item * sleep_interval => $number

Where kernel file change event notification is not available, this argument
controls the interval between checks for file changes. The value is a number in
seconds.  The default is 2 seconds.

=item * statefilename => $filename

Sets the name of the file used to store state between sessions.  Defaults to
'.filetaildirstate' in the working directory.

=item * no_init => 1|0

If no_init is set, the initial contents of the monitored files is skipped and
only the changed contents (since creating the new File::Tail::Dir instance) is
sent.  

The default behaviour (no_init = 0) is for lossless logging, i.e. to send any
contents that has been appended to existing files since last run, and to see all
files without existing state as new files and therefore to send the whole
contents of those files before monitoring for new changes.

=item * max_age => $age_in_seconds

Maximum time in seconds to keep a filehandle open if no changes on the
filehandle have been seen.  Defaults to 3600 sec.

=back

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 watch_files

  $tailer->watch_files()

Blocking call to watch for changes in files forever.  When a change is detected, the process() method is called.

=head2 process

This is the method invoked by watch_files() on file change, which in turn
invokes the callback function specified by the 'L<processor>' option.  If no
callback has been provided, it will print the filename and changed contents to
standard output by default.  This method may be overridden in a subclass instead of using the L<processor> option.  Its signature is:

  sub process {
     my ($self, $filename, $lines) = @_;
     ...
  }

The return value is ignored.

=head2 running

   $running = $tailer->running();  # get status
   $tailer->running(0); # exit event loop

This is set to true when the event loop in watch_files() is entered.  It can be
set to false (e.g. via a signal or in the process() method) to cause
watch_files() to return after processing the current batch of events.

Note that if running is set to false via signal, the event loop will not be
exited until a new file change event is seen.

=head2 save_state

  $tailer->save_state();

Saves internal state to file.  This is always called when watch_files()
completes normally.  However, you may wish to call it directly if you have
installed a signal handler that might not allow watch_files() to complete.

=head2 __PACKAGE__->install_signal_handlers

    File::Tail::Dir->install_signal_handlers();

Installs default signal handlers.  Once installed, on receiving any of HUP, INT,
QUIT or TERM, all instances of File::Tail::Dir will attempt to save their state,
and then exit.

If used, this should be called before any File::Tail::Dir instance is created.
